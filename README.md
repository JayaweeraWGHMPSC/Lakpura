🌟 Lakpura: Showcasing Culture Through Code

As part of my first-year studies, I developed Lakpura, a fully responsive front-end e-commerce website dedicated to showcasing and celebrating traditional Sri Lankan masks.

💻 Front-End Development Highlights:

Built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure a clean, mobile-friendly, and accessible interface.

Designed features such as product categorization, shopping cart, and order history (front-end simulation) to demonstrate a complete shopping journey.

Prioritized UI/UX design, optimizing for performance, accessibility, and seamless navigation across devices.

🌍 The vision behind Lakpura was not just technical, it was cultural. The platform aimed to promote Sri Lankan heritage by giving artisans a digital presence to reach global audiences.

This project was a meaningful first step in my web development journey, where I combined technical learning with cultural storytelling.

🚀 Excited to continue building projects that merge creativity, technology, and impact!
